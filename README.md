# BandLab JUCE Audio FX

This is a work-in-progress real-time audio processor built with JUCE and C++.  
It tests basic Gain and Delay effects to explore audio buffer handling for BandLabâ€™s Audio Core context.

## TODO
- Implement Gain (basic volume control)
- Implement Delay (simple echo buffer)
