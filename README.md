# BandLab JUCE Audio FX

**JUCE-based Real-Time Audio Effect Processor (Gain + Delay, WIP)**

This is a work-in-progress C++ project to explore real-time audio processing using the JUCE framework.

**How it works:**  
- Takes live audio input  
- Applies Gain (volume control)  
- Adds a simple Delay (echo) buffer  
- Outputs the processed audio in real-time

This helps me learn how audio buffers and real-time DSP work, inspired by BandLabâ€™s Audio Core.

**Next:**  
- Add sliders for real-time control  
- Record a short demo video  
- Expand with more FX or a simple MIDI sequencer
