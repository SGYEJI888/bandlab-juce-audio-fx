# bandlab-juce-audio-fx

**JUCE-based Real-Time Audio Effect Processor (Gain + Delay, WIP)**

This is a work-in-progress C++ project for exploring real-time audio processing using the JUCE framework.

**Features (planned):**
- ✔️ Basic Gain control
- ✔️ Simple Delay (echo) effect
- ⏳ Real-time audio input/output testing

This prototype is part of my learning process to understand audio buffer handling and real-time DSP, inspired by BandLab’s Audio Core engine.

More updates will be added after the first interview!
